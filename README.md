## How to set buttons
Once opened for the first time, the bar will show 10 buttons with a "+" sign. When clicked, it opens a configuration window. Just fill it.
Then you'll have your first button configured (Wheee!)

## How to work with the list
Before configured, the list is empty, so you'll have to fill it. To insert tools to the list, you have to click on the logo button (you know, that one with the "#t" at the left of the bar). Then click on "Add tool to list" and almost like with the buttons, you just have to fill the fields required.
To run those tools, just select the tool in the list and click the arrow button besides.

## Resetting the buttons
Quite easy, just go to the logo button (that one with a "#t") and click settings. You'll find some checkboxes there, just check the ones with the number of the buttons you want to reset and click on save.

## Managing the list
So easy too, just go to the logo button (that one with a "#t") and click settings. Then go to the "List items" tab, there you''ll be able to edit the order of your tools and remove those one you want to get rid of. Don't forget to click on save after editing.

## Moving
At start the Toolbar appears on the center of the screen. To move it, just drag clicking in a empty place (we tried to make possible to drag by clicking on the grid left of the logo, but couldn't).
